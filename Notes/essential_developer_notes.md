# My thoughts and notes: 

### 12 - Conforming to feature abstractions
9/30/2023
Coming back after a while, trying to remember waht this project is
It really seems like its more efficient to keep a minimum speed with this as there is a lot of 'reboot' effort each time I start again

A major theme seems to be handling dependency properly, reading the short SOLID whitepaper helped me grasp this
Dependency inversion is when you have elements depend on abstractions (I should read the paper again)
