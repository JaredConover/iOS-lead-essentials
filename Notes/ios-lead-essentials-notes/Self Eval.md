1. What specific accomplishments are you proud of over the last six months? / De quelles réalisations spécifiques es-tu fier(ère) au cours des six derniers mois? 
	- The execution of the approval dashboard filters. Even though it was a relatively simple feature, I took the initiative to build it using current tech/methods and my implementation became the basis for many filter refactors across the app.
	- Mapping out iOS knowledge refactor. Took independent initiative to document and gather the entirety of the old tech present in the iOS knowledge module into easily digestible, visual representation that serves as a map and a tool for discussion with various stake holders.
	- Planning and delivering the first phases of iOS knowledge optional fields refactor. A seemingly simple task on the surface that required me to re-work a core part of how the data was transferred to the editing process. This was mostly an independent initiative with some architectural/design support.
	- I have improved and refined my organization process to better manage how I track all ongoing work and consciously decide how to prioritize action.

Certainly! Here's an improved version of your answers:

1. The execution of the approval dashboard filters. Despite being a relatively straightforward feature, I took the initiative to develop it using the latest technologies and methods. My implementation served as a foundation for several subsequent filter refactors throughout the app. This demonstrated my commitment to investing in the long-term quality of the app.

2. I took the initiative to map out a comprehensive iOS knowledge refactor. Independently, I documented and consolidated all the legacy technologies within the iOS knowledge module. This visual representation serves as a valuable map and discussion tool with various stakeholders, enhancing our collective understanding of the technology landscape. This initiative showcases my commitment to clarity and effective communication within the team.

3. I am also proud of planning and executing the initial phases of the iOS knowledge optional fields refactor. This was a seemingly simple task on the surface that required a significant change to the core data transfer process during editing. While largely an independent initiative, I sought and received architectural and design support to ensure a high quality result. This initiative reflects my dedication to enhancing the efficiency and flexibility of our systems.

4. In addition to specific project accomplishments, I have refined my organizational processes to more effectively manage ongoing work. This includes a conscious effort to prioritize actions based on their urgency/impact. This has contributed to increased efficiency and has positively impacted my overall productivity. I am proud of my commitment to continuous improvement in both my technical skills and work management strategies.

2. How could you improve? / Comment pourrais-tu t'améliorer? 
	- Mostly i think I need to continue on the path I'm on. Specifically I want to find more ways to incorporate testing, something I'm investing in through a course.
	- I could look for more opportunities to integrate testing into the features. I am currently also taking a course on TDD / architecture to help with this.

I believe I need to stay on my current trajectory of growth and look for learning opportunities that align with my role and interests. 
For example, I am looking to explore more ways of incorporating testing into my development process. As part of this commitment, I am actively investing time in a dedicated course focusing on Test-Driven Development (TDD) and architecture. My goal is to apply these principles practically, elevating the overall quality of my work and fostering a more effective development process.

I believe there is almost always room for improvement in how I communicate with the team. I can work on being more concise and mindful of what is relevant and helpful to my teammates. 

Continue to become more autonomous in identifying and executing initiatives that add to the value our team delivers. Specifically, enhancing my ability to prototype, estimate and communicate possible opportunities for app improvement in addition to the features planned by the product team.

I'm sure there are other ways I could improve and am open to suggestions.

4. What 1–3 specific development goals would you like to work on? What kind of support do you need to accomplish these goals? / Quels sont 1 à 3 objectifs de développement professionnel sur lesquels tu aimerais travailler? De quel type de soutien as-tu besoin pour atteindre ces objectifs? 
	- Improve the integration of testing practices into my development process. It would be helpful to have feedback and support around investing a bit more time in improving this.
	- Increase the effectiveness of my communication. mostly Feedback would be helpful, ie: does what I'm saying generally making sense and how much value am I adding to discussions.
	- Bring extra value to the table. Similarly, feedback about my efficiency and clarity. Am I doing a good job of investing energy in the best / most appropriate places? 
	- Help me identify any blindspots I might have. Are these good goals in your opinion? Do you see better things I should be investing in?
	- Maybe integrate more testing?





## Manager Eval

1. What should your manager continue doing? / Qu'est-ce que ton manager devrait continuer à faire? 
	- Continue refining the balance of providing some direction to the team while also allowing a good amount of autonomy. For example, during the phase two refinement you chose a framework for how to proceed and then let the team work from there. 
	- Advocate for us to the product stakeholders in terms of backing up our estimates and inquiring/ensuring that there is work that involves all chapters.

3. What is one thing your manager should start doing? / Y a-t-il une ou des choses que ton manager devrait mettre en place? 
   What does your position 
	- Highlight the things we do well as a team to bolster sense of team pride. It will be meaningful from you as you have perspective on multiple teams. 
	- Help to pre-define the scope of requirements prior to a planning initiative and potentially step in if the team starts to drift from that scope. For example, when we embarked on the phase two refinement, even though work had been done to specify the requirements in a spreadsheet, it seems like we initially got off track for a while.
	- Organize mandatory team haircuts

5. What's the most helpful thing you'd love your manager to do to help you complete your goals? / Quelle est la chose la plus utile que tu souhaiterais que ton manager fasse pour t'aider à atteindre tes objectifs? 
	- Regularly share feedback along with his perspective and insights. Don't be afraid to challenge and critique.
