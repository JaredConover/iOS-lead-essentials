Maybe part of being a senior developer is being familiar enough with frameworks that your planning is actually reliable. This is in contrast to someone still building proficiency who's less sure how things will need to be implemented and needs to figure it out as they go to a greater extent.

Sometimes I get the feeling that product isn't providing us with what we need as clients. I appreciate that we are involved in helping flesh out the initiatives but I still feel like the basic contract between product and eng could be better defined and the quality could be improved.
