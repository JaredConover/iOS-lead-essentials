- switch between editor and search results using keyboard - cmd+j? somethings missing
- laptop specific: vim in xcode can I remap esc somehow?
- Navigating obsidian with keyboard
- Obsidian vimrc to remap esc -> jj
- Some kind of standardization of shortcuts? how could we map this? I don't want different shortcuts for the same actions in Xcode, obsidian, terminal, etc. Vim mode addresses some but not all of this standardization.
- Vim copy an entire function from the beginnning of the definition until the closing }
